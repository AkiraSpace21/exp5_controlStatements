# 💡 C++ Experiment 5: Decision Making (If, If-Else, Nested If)

---

## 🎯 Aim

To write C++ programs that demonstrate **basic decision-making constructs** like:

* `if` statements
* `if-else` statements
* `else-if` ladder
* `nested if` conditions
* Using conditions to perform logical comparisons

---

## 🧠 Objectives

* Learn how to use conditional statements in C++
* Understand branching logic to control program flow
* Handle different user inputs to produce expected outcomes
* Build clean and readable logic through stepwise comparisons
* Improve understanding of syntax and logic in real-world scenarios

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Programming Language**: C++
* **Compiler**: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
* **Editor/IDE**: Visual Studio Code
* **Operating System**: Windows 10

### ✅ 1. Check Whether Number is Positive or Negative

#### 🔁 Steps:

1. Start the program
2. Ask the user to enter a number
3. If the number is greater than 0 → print **positive**
4. Else if it is less than 0 → print **negative**
5. If neither, then print **zero**
6. End the program

---

### ✅ 2. Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd

#### 🔁 Steps:

1. Start the program
2. Ask user to input a number
3. Use modulo: `number % 2 == 0`
4. If true → print **Even**, else → print **Odd**

---

### ✅ 3. Check Whether a Person is Eligible to Vote

#### 🔁 Steps:

1. Start the program
2. Take age as input from the user
3. If age ≥ 18 → print **eligible**
4. Else → print **not eligible**

---

### ✅ 4. Find the Largest Among Two Numbers

#### 🔁 Steps:

1. Start the program
2. Input two numbers
3. Compare them using `if-else`
4. Print the larger number

---

### ✅ 5. Find the Greatest Among Three Numbers

#### 🔁 Steps:

1. Start the program
2. Input three numbers
3. Use `if-else-if` ladder or nested `if` statements
4. Compare each condition to find the greatest
5. Print the greatest number

## 📄 Conclusion

Through this experiment, we successfully learned how to use **decision-making statements** in C++ to make a program respond differently under different inputs. These constructs are **fundamental to logic building** in programming.
