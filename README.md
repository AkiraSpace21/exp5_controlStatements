# ⚙️ Experiment 5 -    Control statements

---

## 🎯  Aim
To write and execute C++ programs demonstrating:
- `if` statement
- `if-else` statement
- `if-else-if` ladder
- `nested if`
- `switch-case`

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Programming Language: **C++**
- IDE: **Visual Studio Code**
- Compiler: **g++**

---

##Theory:Control statements in C++ are used to manage the flow of execution in a program. They allow the program to make decisions, repeat tasks, or jump to specific parts of the code based on certain conditions.  They are essential for implementing logic, repetition, and decision-making in C++ programs, making them more efficient and dynamic.

##📂 Programs

---

### 🔹 Program 1: To find the largest of 3 numbers

#### 🧠 Algorithm:
1.Start
2.Input three numbers: a, b, c
3.If all are equal → print "All numbers are equal"
4.Else if a > b and a > c → print "a is the largest"
5.Else if b > c → print "b is the largest"
6.Else → print "c is the largest"
7.End

---

### 🔹 Program 2: To check whether a number is even or odd.

#### 🧠 Algorithm:
1. Start  
2. Accept an integer  
3. If number % 2 == 0 → Print "Even"  
4. Else → Print "Odd"  
5. End

---

### 🔹 Program 3: Number to week

#### 🧠 Algorithm:
Start

Input number (num)

Use switch(num) to match:

1. 1 → Monday
2. 2 → Tuesday
3. 3 → Wednesday
4. 4 → Thursday
5. 5 → Friday
6. 6 → Saturday
7. 7 → Sunday
8. default → Invalid input

End
---

### 🔹 Program 4: To check if a character is a vowel or consonent

#### 🧠 Algorithm:
1. Start  
2. Accept a character from user  
3. If character is equal to a,e,i,o,u or A,E,I,O,U 
   - character is vowel  
   - Else
   - is a consonent  
5. End

---

### 🔹 Program 5: To perform basic arithmetic operations using a switch-case.

#### 🧠 Algorithm:
1. Start  
2. Accept two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /)  
3. Use switch:
   - Case '+' → Add  
   - Case '-' → Subtract  
   - Case '*' → Multiply  
   - Case '/' → Divide (check if denominator ≠ 0)  
   - Default → Invalid Operator  
4. End

## ✅ Conclusion
- Gained hands-on experience with all decision-making statements in C++.  
- Understood when and where to use `if`, `if-else`, `if-else-if`, `nested if`, and `switch-case` constructs.  
- Learned how flow control works based on conditions.
